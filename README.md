# Circular-Queue
For IIT BOMBAY
     
     A circular queue is the extended version of a regular queue where the last element is connected to the first element. Thus forming a circle-like structure. The circular queue solves the major limitation of the normal queue. In a normal queue, after a bit of insertion and deletion, there will be non-usable empty space.
